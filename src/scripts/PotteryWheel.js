  // 1. Shape of the piece of pottery (e.g. "Mug", "Platter")
  // 1. Weight of the piece (e.g. 1, 5)
  // 1. Height of the piece (e.g. 3, 7)
// The `makePottery` function must return an object with the following properties on it.
  // 1. `shape`
  // 1. `weight`
  // 1. `height`
  // 1. `id` _(increment this value each time the function is invoked)_
